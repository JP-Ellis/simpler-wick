% Scan for the next non-space token and do something depending on
% whether it matches #1 or not.

% #1 : token to look for
% #2 : true code
% #3 : false code

%
% This branches for the next token.  If the scanned token is a space
% (\@sptoken) it keeps on looking.  Otherwise it either branches to the
% true or false code saved earlier.
